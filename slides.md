### Impediments and requirements

#### Impediments to the roadmap

<small>

* [SUSE Nbg network quality is deteriorating](https://progress.opensuse.org/issues/109250)
* Limited team capacity

</small>


#### Resource requirements

<small>

* (unchanged) Additional redundancy for O3 PPC
* (unchanged) Rest of workers needing replacement (nearly all current hardware out of maintenance) but we do not have the personell capacity
* (unchanged) SSD storage for O3 would improve user experience
